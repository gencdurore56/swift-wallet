/*
   This code is a complex application that simulates a virtual ecosystem with plants, animals, and weather patterns.
   It incorporates sophisticated algorithms and advanced concepts in computer science.

   The application includes classes for various components of the ecosystem such as Plant, Animal, and Weather. It also has functions for simulating the environment and generating random events.

   Please note that this code is a simplified version for demonstration purposes and may not represent a full-fledged ecosystem simulation.
